# Customer Churn Prediction and Analysis

## Overview
A machine learning project to predict customer churn. The project covers data collection, exploration, feature engineering, model training, deployment, and monitoring.

## Customer Churn Risk Rate Dataset  

#### Overview  
The **Customer Churn Risk Rate** dataset contains structured tabular data, including, information about customer demographics, account activity, transactional behavior, and other customer-related features that can be leveraged for churn prediction. It was originally provided as part of a HackerEarth Machine Learning Challenge aimed at predicting customer churn risk.  

#### Dataset Sources  
- **Kaggle**: [Churn Risk Rate - HackerEarth ML](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imsparsh/churn-risk-rate-hackerearth-ml/data)  
- **HackerEarth Competition**: [Predict Customer Churn](https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/new/competitive/hackerearth-machine-learning-challenge-predict-customer-churn/)  

#### **Objective**  
The primary goal of this dataset is to **predict customer churn** based on historical data. By analyzing the given features, machine learning models can be trained to identify patterns and classify customers based on their risk of churning.  


## Milestones
- **Data Collection & Preprocessing:** Acquire a churn dataset, perform EDA, and clean the data.
- **Advanced Analysis & Feature Engineering:** Conduct statistical tests and engineer new features.
- **Model Development & Optimization:** Build, train, and tune classification models.
- **MLOps & Deployment:** Deploy the best model as an API and set up performance monitoring.
- **Final Documentation:** Prepare reports and a presentation on project outcomes.
